The Fetch Api is a promise based api which takes place of the functionalities of the XMLHttpRequest(XHR). What does it replace the functionalities of? It takes place of the functionality of the XMLHttpRequest(XHR).What does it provide an interface for? it provides an interface for fetching resources from around the Web, or even from within your own project! It is much more powerful than XHR (AJAX), and much more flexible as well.2. What is a JavaScript Promise? is an object that represents the eventual              completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.3. Why do developers like to use the fetch Api? Developers like to use fetch API because is simple to use with promise chaining. And especially in conjunction with what? Give two reasons. The other reason it is so popular is due to its flexibility and that it is so powerful.4. What is the fetch Api completely based on? The Fetch Api is completely promise based.5. What is the function declaration syntax of a regular named function?function nameOfFunction(abundio) {// code to be executed here}6. What is the first thing the declaration of regular named function begins with? It begins with the function keyword.7. What is that first thing followed by? Is followed by the name of the function.8. What rules do function names follow? Function names follow the same rules as variables. They can contain letters, numbers (but not as the first character of the name), underscores, and $ signs. If there is more than one part to the name, the convention is to use camelCase for easier readability.9. What is promise chaining represented by in our Free IP Geolocation Api project? promise chaining is represented by the .then() blocks here. We use chaining, indicated by the dot (.) before then().10. Why do we use arrow functions inside of the .then() blocks? we use arrow functions inside the .then() block, so that our objects can be seamlessly passed from one .then() block into another, without implementing a lot of extra code that is implicitly achieved with chaining.11. What is the GoeLocation Api? The Geolocation Api is a web api that allows the user to provide their location to web applications if they want to.12. What must applications add to their application code in order to be able to use the Geolocation Api? MUST add the geolocation permission property to their code.There are two pieces involved. Explain what each piece represents. Applications that want to use the Geolocation API must add the geolocation permission property “navigator.geolocation”. by using this the users will give access to get their location.This will prompt the user’s device to get location access. It returns a geolocation object that gives web content access to the location of any device. The navigator contains information about the current browser; including whether or not it supports the Geolocation property.13. How does the user allow the application to access their location? Use the application that you build to find out how. When you click to get your location, you will be asked to allow or block by the current domain. On the top left corner is going to show a box where you have two options to allow or block. It only gives you location if you allow your device to get your location. 14. If the Geolocation Api is available in the active browser window, what built-in Geolocation method do we use to get the location of the user by longitude and latitude coordinates? We use “.getCurrentPosition()” built-in method by passing a reference to geoSuccess to get “.getCurrentPosition()” querying #map=18 followed by ${latitude}/ ${longittude} takes you to the user’s current location on a map.
